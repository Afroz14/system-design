# Description
1. Mentorship
2. redo your project, how do you improve it this time.
简单问了问。有几个问题自己以前没仔细考虑过。最大的难点？在test过程中哪部分最容易出错？如果重来，你会对哪部分做修改？大家有时间可以考虑一下啊。
3. Engineering manager warm up
然后问了个high level的问题说，一个user enter company or univeristy information when signing on, how to help the user better locate his company/univeristy? 我先说用hashtable存company/university 和id pairs，然后用trie实现auto-completion帮助user完成Look-up。他说对，但是太detail了，问High-level怎么快速locate？我说可以combine location, rank of the top selected company/university, connection’s company/univerity, logo来推荐。
他又问如果用户填资料的时候没有选对应的选项，自己填了一个怎么办？我说可以暂时存null，之后再让用户complete information
4. Talked about Interests and why LinkedIn. I only asked a couple of questions at the end. Only lasted 50 mins for this round.

# Why are you looking
## Career growth
* I want to first become an expert in a specific area in 5 years. As long as the problem is within that area, I am always the problem solver and stopper, the go-to person in that area. My current company is roughly 20 years old and has a broad product line. My team is a really small team and it is really hard for me to focus on a specific area. I think there are more such technical specialist positions within big companies and that's why I am looking for a change. 

## Challenges
* I am interested in large-scale distributed systems and data processing. LinkedIn has a global infrastructure, large amounts of data and the 10-year vision of building a global economic graph. Some of the most famous open-source technologies such as Kafka, Samza, Rest.li and Voldemort were born in LinkedIn. The same goes with many famous startups such as Confluent. I think I could contribute and learn a lot here. 

# Why LinkedIn is interesting

## What current projects do I like
### Salary feature
### Company profile page

## What future projects do you want to work on
### LinkedIn learning
#### What has been done
* LinkedIn learning was launched in this year. It is the same as Lynda.com from the content information. But it could provides more personalized recommendations when combined with information from LinkedIn. It is a great effort to make more members engaged. Now no longer is the case that only when they want to change their job, they go back to LinkedIn. Every day they will log into LinkedIn because that's where they learn.

#### What do I want to improve
* Problem
	- There are so many MOOC courses and each has its strengths. For example, Coursera wants to bring famous university courses online. Pluralsight focus on professional IT training. Udemy and Lynda.com provides pretty comprehensive contents. For example, from photography to business skills. 
	- LinkedIn has roughly 500 million members and LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every professional. Only suggesting contents from Lynda.com is pretty limited.
	- Nowadays there are too many online courses and it takes time for every member to find the most suitable ones for them. LinkedIn has unique advantages in solving this problem.

* Solution
 	- Instead, I suggest that each online course should have a profile on LinkedIn. LinkedIn learning's recommendations not only suggests content from Lynda.com but also all MOOC courses. When users want to learn some skills online, just ask LinkedIn. By doing this, LinkedIn can become the professional coach for every member. 
 	- This will make users more engaged in LinkedIn and align well with LinkedIn's vision. Personally, I am pretty interested in big data analytics products. LinkedIn provides a number of analytics products such as "People you may know", "Jobs you may be interested in", "News feed".
